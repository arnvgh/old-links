### LinkZia is a links manager 🔗, built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) .


# Ussage


```bash
git clone https://github.com/its-ag/linkzia.git
yarn install
yarn run dev
```

- Go to ```src/data.ts``` and add/update the arrays with your own details.
- I have used [Astro Icon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/astro-icon) which uses [Iconify](https://iconify.design/) for icons, you can use any other svg icon library.
